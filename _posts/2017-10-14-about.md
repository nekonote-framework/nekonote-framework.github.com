<p class="post-date">{{ page.date | date: "%a, %b %d, %Y" }}</p>

I released {{site.product}} as open beta.

{{site.product}} is a small Ruby web application framework that helps your web development.

Please see this chapter <a href="{{site.data.document.contents.getting_started.path}}">{{site.data.document.contents.getting_started.num}}. {{site.data.document.contents.getting_started.title}}</a>
to get started web development with {{site.product}}.

You need to use `--pre` option when install pre-beta version like `gem install nekonote-framework --pre`.

Please pay attention to beta version. There is a possiblity of some bugs.
The number of the beta version will be increased as `1.0.0-beta2`, `1.0.0-beta3`, when the source code had a change.

I will continue improving {{site.product}} and would appliciate it if you contribute to this project.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to contact me =(^x^=
